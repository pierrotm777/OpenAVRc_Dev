## Tech Facts

`ExpressLRS` is an **open-source** remote control link!

* Based on `SX127x`/`SX1280` hardware combined with an `ESP8285`, `ESP32` or `STM32` for the receiver (RX) and transmitter (TX) respectively.
* Multi-Band Support for **868/915 MHz and 2.4 GHz** - possibly more in the future.
* Can be flashed onto **existing hardware** (`Frsky R9M`) or **custom PCBs** can be made.
* Runs at up to 250hz (or down to 50hz) updates per second (transmission rate) depending on your preference of **range or low latency**:
  * At 868/915 MHz a packet rate of **up to 200 Hz** is supported. Stick latency can be low as 6.5ms as seen on firmware with `crsfshot` (aka `OpenTX 2.4` mixer scheduling) support. üß† 
  * At **2.4 GHz** up to 500 Hz is supported (only on 2.3.10). üö§ 
  * Due to the optimized packet structure **only basic telemetry** that gives up/downlink information is currently supported. Basic telemetry currently includes: RQLY, TQLY, RSSI x2, SNR x2, and VBAT‚ö†Ô∏è

## Build Status

We do [continuous integration](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/actions) and according quality assurance as far as possible.
